# to be able to run maple from u of e inf network
# we need password-less login which is disabled in inf default sshd
# do this by starting our own sshd server

# login to some machine with maple(e.g.) master, then
# (with config files set in sshd)
cd sshd
/usr/sbin/sshd -f sshd_config -p 2422

# however most port/machines are not visible
# so we have to make the port visible somewhere else
ssh -N -R 2422:localhost:2422 -l alex heneveld.org &
# (that does port forwarding to heneveld.org;
# you could instead to do your local machine, 
# but only if it is visible from inf!)


# then maple can be run by
ssh -l s9811254 -p 2422 alex.heneveld.org maple -q

#e.g.

echo "x+x;" | ssh -l s9811254 -p 2422 alex.heneveld.org maple -q

# should show 2x (ignoring error output)
